# NOTE ABOUT IMAGES

Images here are in the public folder, but this is just to make it simple for demonstration purposes. They should *not* be hosted there in a production version of a site from this template. You run into hosting limitations on static sites, and these places aren't optimized for retrieving images. You're going to want to host them online somewhere else and just use those links. If there are a limited amount of images to manage, https://imgur.com is pretty good for just throwing an image up and hotlinking it wherever (you can upload images without posting them to the imgur community). If you're using this for a larger project with more images to manage, you should probably set up some sort of image storage bucket and link from there. Cloudflare's R2 storage seems to be pretty good limits and capacity in their free tier (requires a credit card, but you don't get charged until ~10million reads/month). There are some other decent options with decent free/cheap tiers too.
